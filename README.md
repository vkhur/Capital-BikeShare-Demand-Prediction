# Capital-BikeShare-Demand-Prediction
Capital Bikeshare network want to expand their rental station across Washington DC. They have the data of the customer who have rented the bike in the year 2016 to 2018 and the data of the atmosphere( humidity, windspeed, wind gust, precipitation, pressure etc) when the bike were rented.The challenge are the fluctuating demand  and ridership pattern.  I have used machine learning model( Linear Regression) to get the answer of question such as 
1) Best time of the year to use promotion strategy?
2) How different factor effect the rider decision?  
3) How different timing will effect the operation decisions?
4) Limitations
Spotify wonâ€™t allow to pull data for multiple users because of their security reasons. They allow users to pull data for single user account.
We started with Tableau then we used PowerBI because Tableau was not able to display Artist images directly from web URLs.
