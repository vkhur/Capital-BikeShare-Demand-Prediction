# Capital-BikeShare-Demand-Prediction

# Background
Capital Bikeshare is a regional public and private partnership bike sharing program owned by DDOT(District Department of transportation) and operated by a private firm Motive. It is operated in Washington DC and neighboring countries.
This program mission is “ to transform our community by providing a high quality, convenient and affordable bicycle transit system that will connect people to more places where they live, work and play in the region”.
By, 2018, Capital Bikeshare had more than 4300 bicycle and 500 stations. It has provided 20 million rides in Washington DC till date.

# Problem
DDOT is planning expansion of 40 new bike rental station and its Bicycle program specialist, Aaron Goldbeck was reviewing it.
The challenges Capital Bikeshare for future expansion are:
1) Fluctuation in demand for bike rentals among station across whole system.
2) Who were the riders that used Capital Bikeshare?
3) When did they ride?
4) What days of the week were most rides taken on?
5) What factor affecting riding behavior?

# Quantitative Approach 
1) Loading data 
2) Pre-processing
3) Data cleaning
4) Dividing columns into continuous and categorical column
5) Univariate Analysis
6) Bivariate Analysis
7) Plotting heatmaps( correlation between features)
8) Pre-processing Steps
9) Dummy variable creation
10) Splitting Data into training and testing data sets
11) Dividing into X and Y sets for the model building
12) Building our model 
13) Finding the weights and bias
14) Testing

# Recommendation and Action Plan
1) One of the challenge of capital Bikeshare was the difficulty in meeting demand. So, by this analysis it is clear that peak demand hours in the morning from 7AM to 9 AM and maximum at 8 AM. 
2) The demand of Bicycle is more in weekdays rather than in weekends.
3) Ridership pattern changed as per seasonality, in summer there is more number of bike rented then in winter.
4) Temperature plays a vital role when the temperature is between 20 -30 then more bikes are rented. 
5) It is recommended to expand 40 bike station during summer when the demand is high. The bike station should be near the office areas and tourist place as the demand is high in morning and evening.
6) The best time of the year for promotion will be after spring and start of winter because at that time demand is less and by iving promotion more customer can be attracted.
